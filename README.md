# Notebooks Forge

A project dedicated to build and provide ``Notebooks`` servers for ``Defensive`` and ``Offensive`` operators to:

* Design playbooks
* Demonstrate how techniques can be used
* Showcase when and why an operator would want to use a technique
* Document engagements procedures
* Prototype new ways to analyze data extracted from endpoints in a more dynamic, flexible and language-agnostic way.

This project supports two notebook server types such as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) notebooks.

## What is a Notebook?

Think of a notebook as a document that you can access via a web interface that allows you to save input (i.e live code) and output (i.e code execution results) of interactive sessions as well as important notes needed to explain the methodology and steps taken to perform specific tasks (i.e data analysis).

# Current Status: Alpha

The project is currently in an alpha stage, which means that the code and the functionality are still changing. We haven't yet tested the system with large data sources and in many scenarios. We invite you to try it and welcome any feedback.
