# Notebooks Forge

A collection of notebooks built for defensive and offensive operations.

Defensively and Offensively, notebooks are a great alternative to :

* Design "offensive playbooks" to demonstrate to operators how adverdsarial techniques can be used.
* Showcase when and/or why you would want to use each technique.

When it comes to threat detection, how many times have you heard someone say "It is all in my head, just ask me if you have any questions!" or "Only he/she/they know(s) how to do it!" Plenty of times, right?. Not documenting, standardizing or sharing how to analyze data to detect potential intrusions in a network is more common than you think,  especially when the team is very diverse from a technical and expertise perspective. It does not only affect your detection strategies but also the dynamics of your team. Now, how many times have you also thought about a more efficient, intuitive or creative way to analyze the security events your organization collects, but you feel limited to the capabilities of a one language-dependent search bar?.

This project introduces the concept of utilizing Notebooks for a more dynamic, flexible and language-agnostic way to analyze security events, and at the same time help your team document, standardize and share detection playbooks. There are a few environments that will be supported such as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) notebooks.

## What is a Notebook?

Think of a notebook as a document that you can access via a web interface that allows you to save input (i.e live code) and output (i.e code execution results) of interactive sessions as well as important notes needed to explain the methodology and steps taken to perform specific tasks (i.e data analysis).

# Goals

* Provide portable free hunting notebook environments to the community and share the basics of Threat Hunting.
* Expedite the time it takes to deploy Notebook servers.
* Improve the testing of hunting use cases in an easier and more affordable way.
* Facilitate the analysis of security events in a more dynamic, flexible and language-agnostic way.
* Allow security analysts to develop, test, and validate data analytics.
* Enable data science capabilities for security analysts to test and learn from.

# Current Status: Alpha

The project is currently in an alpha stage, which means that the code and the functionality are still changing. We haven't yet tested the system with large data sources and in many scenarios. We invite you to try it and welcome any feedback.
