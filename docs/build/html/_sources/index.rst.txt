Notebooks Forge
===============

A project dedicated to build and provide ``Notebooks`` servers for ``Defensive`` and ``Offensive`` operators to:

* Design playbooks
* Demonstrate how techniques can be used
* Showcase when and why an operator would want to use a technique
* Document engagements procedures
* Prototype new ways to analyze data extracted from endpoints in a more dynamic, flexible and language-agnostic way.

This project supports two notebook server types such as `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ and `Zeppelin <https://zeppelin.apache.org/>`_.


What is a Notebook?
*******************

Think of a notebook as a document that you can access via a web interface that allows you to save input (i.e live code) and output (i.e code execution results / evaluated code output) of interactive sessions as well as important notes needed to explain the methodology and steps taken to perform specific tasks (i.e data analysis).
