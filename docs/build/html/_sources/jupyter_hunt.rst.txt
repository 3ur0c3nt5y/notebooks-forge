The top-level class S3FileSystem holds connection information and allows typical file-system style operations like cp, mv, ls, du, glob, etc., as well as put/get of local files to/from S3.

Elasticsearch-DSL
*****************

`Elasticsearch DSL <https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py>`_ is a high-level library whose aim is to help with writing and running queries against Elasticsearch.
It is built on top of the official low-level client (`elasticsearch-py <https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py>`_).
It provides a more convenient and idiomatic way to write and manipulate queries.
It stays close to the Elasticsearch JSON DSL, mirroring its terminology and structure.
It exposes the whole range of the DSL from Python either directly using defined classes or a queryset-like expressions.
